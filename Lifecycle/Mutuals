What is CMMI?

CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is basically the way an organization goes through the Tuckman model.

The Tuckman model is broken into four steps: forming, storming, norming, and performing.

CMMI goes through these stages: initial, managed, defined, quantitatively managed, and optimized.
