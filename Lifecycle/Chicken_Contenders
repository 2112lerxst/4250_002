Tyler-Implementation:
Def- Putting the design/architecture to action, making sure you can trace it back to the requirements.
Notes:
* 3rd stage of SE lifecycle
* The effects of implementation can change the design
* This is the actual code and development
* Documenting the code and tracability
* Ensuring all requirements are met
* Detailed design is a precondition for implementation
* working software is a postcondition

Tyler-Test:
Def- Creating examples to perform on software to ensure all requirements are met
Notes:
* This is the stage you realised you messed up
* The more cases the better
* This stage occurs multiple times
* This stage ensures all requirments are met
* unit testing-> happy paths and edge cases
* shows final changes needed to the project
* finds errors in the in the implementation
* you should create documented test cases
* potentially lead back to implementation
* third phase to tracability matrix as a postcondition
* fourth stage of the SE Lifecycle
