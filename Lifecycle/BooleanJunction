CMMI Definition - Model that helps develop a simple process into a refined one by focusing on improving one/few aspects at a time. The improvements raise the tier they are at in the model. Higher tiers lead to more major improvements.


Design - Design is the framework of the project based on the requirements given, and gives high level solutions to the subproblems defined. Risk assessment is considered during this phase, ensuring the project
will be finished in the estimate. The requirements are used to map key elements with a traceability matrix, making it easier to transfer to the implementation phase.
