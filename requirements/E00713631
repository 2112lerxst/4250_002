Requirement Format for Ball Bouncing Program

1. Formal Requirement

The system must detect and handle collisions between the ball and user-drawn obstacles.

2. User Story

As a user, I want the program to accurately detect collisions between the ball and the obstacles I draw so that I can create interesting interactions on the screen.

3. Requirements Analysis

Testable: The program's collision detection mechanism will be thoroughly tested to ensure that it accurately detects collisions between the ball and user-drawn obstacles.

Traceable: Each collision detection test case will be linked to this requirement, allowing for easy verification of completeness.
